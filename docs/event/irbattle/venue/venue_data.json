    "comment": "Making a scratch sabun chart can be awkward. Most of the time, the pattern of the scratches are determined by the song itself, not the chart maker. Because of this, the scratch patterns usually can't be changed much from the default charts. Also, most of the time, the default charts for \"scratch\" songs are already quite fun to play, so there is little need to make a sabun.<br><br>This leaves us with a few options when making a scratch sabun:<br>1. Find a \"scratch\" song, with fun scratch rhythms, but the default charts are not well balanced or the notes do not flow well with the scratch rhythm. We can make a more balanced sabun chart.<br>2. Find a \"scratch\" song, where many of the \"scratch\" keysounds are not included in the chart.<br>3. Make a scratch sabun from a non-scratch song (using keysounds which are not normally used for scratch, like scratch snares, scratch piano etc)<br><br>I didn't want to do (3), so I tried to look for (1) or (2). I think THz belongs to category (2). THz [7k Another] already has plenty of scratch, and is also quite fun to play, but many of the scratch keysounds are not used in the chart. I wanted to try making a chart that makes use of most of these scratch keysounds.<br><br>I started by moving all of the scratch keysounds (vocals, scratch sounds etc) to the scratch lane. This is so that I don't miss any scratch keysounds later. When making the chart, I would move notes from the scratch lane back to the B lanes if the scratches are not appropriate.<br><br>When I start charting the notes, I quickly realized that while the song is great, the keysounding of this BMS is horrible. All of the labels 01-ZZ are used, and it seems like many of the keysounds were left uncut because they ran out of keysound labels. Also, it seems like all of the hat_###.ogg and snare2_###.ogg keysounds (N4~M2) are not present in the song folder, so there are a lot of silent keysounds in the song. I wonder if those keysounds were intentionally removed, or the artist forgot to include the keysounds in the download. There are also very few useable keysound objects for charting, so I tried to make tricky patterns with few notes.<br><br>I have a rule when using blank keysounds. I will only use blank keysounds to make chords larger. However, because all keysound labels (01-ZZ) are already used, it was difficult for me to use blank keysounds. After a bit of searching, I noticed keysound M9=snare2_000.ogg is not used anywhere in the chart. So I deleted the definition #WAVM9 snare2_000.ogg and used M9 for blank keysounds. This way, the chart passes the keysound misalignment check.<br><br>I still don't have a lot of experience when designing good scratch charts, but I have a few theories.<br>1. There should be breaks in the scratch patterns. If there are no breaks, it would be difficult to recover from a single BAD chain. It is also good to allow the player to \"reset\" their hand position on the turntable.<br>2. Scratch is difficult for timing, so I think having a few regular notes makes timing easier.<br>3. Memorizing scratch rhythms is common. It is important for the scratch rhythm to match the music well, so that the player can learn the rhythm easily.<br><br>To make the chart fun to play, in the gaps between scratch chains, I tried to use patterns that are played with both hands (LN or large chords). During scratch chains, I often use patterns that can be played with one hand. I think switching between 1-hand and 2-hand playstyles is fun.<br><br>Overall, it was a tricky chart to make, but I hope the final chart is fun.<br><br>I am not sure how to rate the difficulty of this chart. Probably somewhere between ★5 and ★8.<br><br>Time spent: ~1 week"

    "comment": "The 2KEYS tag was inspired by 甘でラッシュ！ by U咲 in BOFU2016. This entry had the standard N/H/A charts, plus a [2KEYS] chart. I played the 2KEYS chart out of curiosity, and it turned out to be the most fun default chart for the song. <br><br>Setting constraints fosters creativity. I've always wanted to try this for myself, to see whether I could make an interesting chart using only two keys. After all, 甘でラッシュ！ could do it, Muse Dash could do it. I think 2KEYS charts are fun because the player can focus their index fingers to jack the two keys (it is easier to enjoy jacks when there is no worry about other lanes). I found that my most stable stance is to join my index and middle fingers to press the button together.<br><br>It seems like the most suitable songs for 2KEYS charts are songs that are relatively fast, and have complex/varied rhythms. The Legend of Eastern Rabbit is one of my favorite songs from PABAT!2020. It's fast, exciting, has crazy rhythms, and I absolutely love the BGA. It is extremely fun to listen to and play. I was excited when this song was introduced to Muse Dash, but they used a cut version of the song which removed many of the exciting parts. I think the BMS version is much better.<br><br>I think the fast rhythms in the background (from the oriental string instrument I can't identify) could make for some very fun jacks. I was considering making a sabun for it, but DK made one (★7) before I could. The chart was fun, though it didn't have as many jacks as I hoped.<br><br>With 2KEYS, the patterns I have to work with are basically jacks, trills and LNs. Most of the difficulty will have to come from jacks, which is perfect for this song. Oriental string instrument = jacks, fast guitar = trills, long guitar = LNs.<br><br>With two lanes, I have two options to make patterns:<br>1. Use both lanes to represent one instrument<br>2. Put a different instrument on each lane<br>The chart is tricky to make because I can only represent one or two instruments at a time. More instrumentally complex sections will have to be simplified, by choosing which instrument I want to focus on.<br>If I want to make a trill (e.g. fast guitar), I have to use both lanes for this one instrument. If I am making jacks, I can use one instrument on each lane. So jacks are much easier to make than trills.<br><br>I think using Long Notes is good for emphasising the more prominent guitar sounds. However, using a long note means I only have one lane left for the other instrument. I can do LN+jack, but I don't have enough lanes for LN+trill, so it is difficult to chart patterns which are long guitar + fast guitar.<br><br>One more thing I did was include jacks in my trills to make the trills more interesting (e.g. 17117111771 instead of 17171717171). I listened to each of the fast guitar riffs individually, figure out how I could mix in jacks into the pattern. For example, in a melody, a note can have a higher or lower pitch than the previous. If we decrease in pitch twice in a row, I might make it a jack. If it switches from decreasing to increasing, I switch to the other lane.<br><br>Hopefully I have made a chart that is fun to play and represents the music well.<br><br>Time spent: ~1-2 weeks"

    "comment": "Recommend MAX BPM FIX<br><br>The \"variety\" tag is quite straightforward to understand. It's what I like to do - have many different elements in my charts, like LN, scratch and jacks. I find that many of my recent charts would satisfy the \"Variety\" requirement.<br><br>God Morning - Jacks, Scratch, Soflan, LN<br>Gimme All The Cocaine - Scratch, Soflan, LN, Long Trill<br>THz - Jacks, Scratch, LN<br><br>Because my charts usually satisfy the \"variety\" requirement, it didn't feel like I really did anything special for this chart. It just feels like what I would normally do. I tried to add more LN and scratch than usual though. It has plenty of LN and scratch, but I don't know if it really has enough to qualify as an LN chart, or a 皿 chart. It's just... in the middle of everything, so I'm not really sure what this chart is for.<br><br>It seems like many BMS patterns focus only on chordstreams and chords (and sometimes jacks and zure). There is a tendency to remove \"unique\" patterns like LN and scratch when making a sabun from a default chart, which can make a song lose part of what makes it interesting. I think this charting meta creates a playerbase with unbalanced skillsets - strong at density, weak at everything else (scratch, LN, trills, soflan etc). I wish modern tables would contain more charts that are good for practicing varied skill sets.<br><br>I tried experimenting with some LN + scratch patterns in this song. They are quite tricky to make, because they have the potential to form unreachable patterns. My main trick is to keep LNs short, and try to put LNs between, not during scratches. I think the LNs give the effect of \"jumping\" your hand between the keys and the turntable.<br><br>Another idea I experiment with here is the \"low scroll speed BSS\" section. When playing a BSS note on a controller, the player only has one hand to play all seven keys. Most players are not good with playing complex patterns with only one hand. My experiment here is to make a 1-handed pattern, but at a low scroll speed (105bpm = 60% scroll) in measure #80-81. A slower scroll speed should give an inexperienced one-hand player more time to prepare.<br><br>One pattern I used twice in this chart is the \"fast scratch + trill\" burst pattern (measures #55, #97). I personally find this pattern fun and tricky to do, and previously used it in my S≠M [BUNNY EXTINCTION] chart. I think many people may not like this pattern though, because it is difficult to play. I like the pattern, so I decided to keep it.<br><br>This was the first chart I made for IR battle, but I wasn't satisfied with it, and just left it there to slowly make adjustments over the past four weeks.<br>Overall, I think this was an okay chart. I think I could have done better, because this is such a good, varied and interesting song."

    "comment": "Recommend MAX BPM FIX<br><br>Soflan is a strange thing. For example, this song (Gimme All The Cocaine) is 96-198bpm. The first half of the song is in 96bpm, and the second half is 198bpm. Reading at 0.5x scroll speed is very difficult, but this song becomes very easy if you gear change between the first and second halves of the song. Because there is no need to read at 0.5x scroll, it doesn't feel like a soflan song at all.<br><br>I think soflan patterns can be cool when the chart suddenly speeds up or slows down, like a rollercoaster. Soflan gives a lot of emphasis to intense or slow parts of the song, which can make the chart very exciting to watch and play. However, soflan is often annoying to the average player, because they may need to memorize gear changes to play the chart properly. Also, most soflan are 0.5x or 2.0x speed (like 100-200-400bpm), which can be quite difficult to read without a gear change.<br><br>The concept for the \"Gentle Soflan (やさしいソフラン)\" tag is to create a soflan chart that is easy for the average player to play, without needing to memorize gear changes. The two main ideas are:<br>- BPM changes are slight (not 0.5x or 2.0x), so the average player can still read the slow patterns without a gear change.<br>- The BPM changes often, so that gear changing is not a good strategy.<br>My objective is to create a soflan chart that is comfortable for first-time play.<br>Also, the player is encouraged to read slow notes, instead of using gear changes.<br><br>The final chart is 140~196bpm. I use a few different BPMs: 140,154,168,182,196, which are 10/14=71.4%, 11/14, 12/14, 13/14, 14/14=100% scroll speed respectively. I use a time signature trick to ensure the song stays the same: For example, if I want 11/14 scroll speed, I will set the BPM to 154, and set the time signature of the measure to 11/14=0.7857142857142857 by editing the bms in a text editor. I only change scroll speed at the start of the measure, because otherwise it would be too complicated.<br><br>I used a Python script to generate the \"BPM charging\" effect during the starting and ending BSS note.<br><br>I made most of the chart while streaming on Twitch. However, even though I had finished charting every part of the song at the end of the broadcast, it doesn't mean my chart is complete. Most of the time is spent on checking and test playing. I think it is important to repeatedly visually check the patterns by watching the autoplay and test play the chart, so I can make adjustments.<br><br>For example, I made plenty of adjustments to the chordstream sections of the chart offline. When I initially make the chordstream sections, I tend to arbitrarily place notes because it is faster to do. However, arbitrarily placed chordstreams tend to be uninteresting to play. Later on, what I like to do is to listen to the music and watch the chart over and over again, and try to adjust the patterns in the chordstream to more closely fit the flow of the music. For this chart, I added gaps, gachi and large chords in the streams to emphasize big sounds, and changed some of the streams to trills to emphasize the wobble bass. <br><br>I think the most obvious feature of this chart is the long trill. The long trill plays at 196bpm, but it displays 168bpm because it is moving at 85.7% scroll speed. This was something I made in the beginning. It was supposed to be a temporary pattern, because I know many people don't like long trills. But it turned out to be incredibly fun to play (for me).<br>After playing it lots of times, on different randoms, on both keyboard and controller, without FAST/SLOW on, I decided that it's not difficult at all...? Or do I just have a strange skill set?<br><br>I find that it's easy to position your hands to get ready for the trill, because the measure before the trill scrolls slowly at 140bpm (~71.4% scroll), so you have time to see which two buttons the trill is on and get ready. On controller, I usually use two hands to do the trill. But if the trill is on keys 2+4 (I'm P2), I will use my middle and index finger on one hand. On keyboard, I will use my index and middle finger on one hand to do the trill if I get 1+2 or 6+7 (I play SDF space L:\").<br><br>Other than the trill, I think this chart should be quite comfortable to play. Hopefully it is fun and exciting like a good soflan chart should be."
